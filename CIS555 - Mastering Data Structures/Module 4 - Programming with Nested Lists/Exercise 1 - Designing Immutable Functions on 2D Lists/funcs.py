def row_sums(table):
    """
    Returns a list that is the sum of each row in a table.
    
    This function assumes that table has no header, so each row has only numbers in it.
    
    Examples: 
        row_sums([[0.1,0.3,0.5],[0.6,0.2,0.7],[0.5,1.1,0.1]]) returns [0.8, 1.5, 1.7]
        row_sums([[0.2,0.1],[-0.2,0.1],[0.2,-0.1],[-0.2,-0.1]]) returns [0.3, -0.1, 0.1, -0.3]
    
    Parameter table: the nested list to process
    Precondition: table is a table of numbers.  In other words, 
        (1) table is a nested 2D list in row-major order, 
        (2) each row contains only numbers, and 
        (3) each row is the same length.
